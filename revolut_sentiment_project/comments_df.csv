I couldn't test RevPay though but I'm assuming it would be a similar price.  Where you can actually get a good price for the money is in exchanging it for air miles. For instance an Avio might be usually valued at 0.02‚Ç¨ and even 0.04‚Ç¨ in long hauls flights. If you do one or two long haul flights per year it makes economic sense to earn RevPoints instead of cashback, on the Ultra plan you might be earning 2-4% cashback then.",2024-07-26T15:47:39Z

Not sure if I will renew it at ¬£14.99 next year üò¨ Some of the offers are ok such as Amazon which offers between 3-9X revpoints (it changes every few weeks for me but up to 4.5% is pretty good), and I order all of my family‚Äôs Amazon orders to maximise points. The problem is, I‚Äôm not a frequent flyer with any of the airlines that use Avios or flying blue so it‚Äôs a real waste.. so I‚Äôve been converting my avios to nectar points to buy Eurostar vouchers (1:1) but sadly nectar points are only worth 0.5p which reduces my ‚Äúcash back‚Äù down to up to 2.25% - but it‚Äôs still ok so far. Is it worth it? I‚Äôm not sure, I‚Äôd rather have actual money to use on whatever I want. Pairing Curve + Chase for Amazon purchases (1%+1%) might be more worthwhile.

WTF..
 
They are asking bills for the money coming in, while they know what I do and they see from the names from the accounts sending the money that it is related to what I do. 
With this my trust in them has gone down the drain and know that the experience of other customers are no bogus. While CS during the process delivering the documents say the account was never blocked, it clearly states in the account it is.  So they lie as well. That falls very bad for me. I could not test if it was blocked, because then my account was zero, but the statement in the app made it really clear. So I had to open a new business account at a regular local bank on the spot at that time and inform the companies I sent bills to, to change the accountnumber. 

This is their nasty way of treating their good customers, by blocking their accounts without any reason obviously, because a day later they say that the checks are ok and my account is completely working again.

194,gQscaDIRaMQ,@jefflambert7513,Thank You for the review.  Been trying to decide whether to go with Wise or Revolut.  Appreciate the info.  We travel to Japan every couple of years or so and plan on moving there as expats in maybe 4 to 7 years.  Kinda want to take advantage of exchange rates now to save for when we do got there.  Just haven't been able to pull the trigger since Wise states it is not a savings account and that is exactly what we would be using the jars for.  Thanks again !!,2024-04-28T02:39:06Z
